# Purpose
This project is simply just me going through a Udemy tutorial that I found on reddit. I am using it to become more familiar with the Godot Engine, and game development in general. If you're interested in 2D platformers, all of the code will be here for you to download if you want. It has the MIT license, so feel free to download, alter, and re-upload anything in this project to your hearts content.
